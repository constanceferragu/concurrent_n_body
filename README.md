# concurrent_n_body


Next Steps:

GENERATOR: We need to create a generator that generates random bodies. This will make testing easier - avoid creating the bodies ourselves one by one. 

SETUP: We need to decide if we will have a container with boundaries - what happens if a body hits a boundary. 

MODEL: We then need to create the loop the updates the positions and think about how we will make our code lock-free.
